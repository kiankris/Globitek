## Notes

For Bonus Objective 2, the message is limited to 245 characters. I considered increasing this to 400 but when I tried to do so the encrypted result was not displaying prompting me to leave it at 245.  

Verifying that my results were correct was relatively tedious in that I did not have a nice tool that would let me encrypt/decrypt and sign messages very quickly outside of using the functions that I had built.

    Cannot access APEX from this location. Send new agent codename and public key so I can contact. Encrypt response to protect codename. Include signature to verify identity and message integrity. -- sydneybristow
